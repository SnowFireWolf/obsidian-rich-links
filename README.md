## Obsidian Rich Links Plugin

This is a Rich Links plugin for Obsidian that allows you to convert URLs in your notes to rich link previews like you're used to with Notion.

NOTE: This is an early release created mainly as a proof of concept. If you find any issues, [please let me know](https://github.com/dhamaniasad/obsidian-rich-links/issues).
